        My name is Sylwia. I was born in Lublin, Poland. After finishing high
        school, I moved to Dublin, Ireland. At the moment I am living in the
        Netherlands.

        My journey as a developer started as a teenager when desiged and coded
        my first blog. After that, I knew that this was something I enjoyed
        doing and I was good at. I decided to study web development and in 2018
        I got my degree in Computing in Multimedia and Web Engineering from IADT
        in Dublin. During the second year, I studied Mobile Media at the
        Stuttgart Media University in Germany as part of the Erasmus Exchange
        Program. My study was very multidisciplinary, combining the artsy nature
        of my college with the technical side of the course. Thus, within the
        field of web engineering, I am largely invested in front-end design and
        development.

        My hobbies are traveling in foreign countries and exploring my local
        area through sightseeing, cycling and hiking. I love to spend time
        reading books on my Kindle and every year I manage to read more and more
        novels, thrillers and non-fiction. Since last year, thanks to bullet
        journaling I rediscovered joy in drawing, painting and meticulous
        planning.
